## Printf project
> The printf project is a collaboration between Wandhe OYOYO and Sylvester Nganga (***Software Engineering students at ALX***)
- Where a function named **_printf** imitates the actual ***printf*** command located in the <stdio.h> library.
- It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of printf.
